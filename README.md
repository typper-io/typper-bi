## ü§ñ Setting Up the OpenAI Assistant

This project includes an OpenAI Assistant that helps automate and manage your calendar through natural language. Follow the steps below to create and integrate the assistant:

1. **Create an Assistant on the OpenAI Platform:**

   - Visit the [OpenAI Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/assistants) page.
   - Click on "Create Assistant."
   - Fill in the details such as the name, description, and abilities of your assistant.
   - Ensure you enable the ability to run code within the assistant's settings.
   - Save the Assistant and copy the `ASSISTANT_ID`.

2. **Add the Assistant ID to Environment Variables:**

   - Open your `.env.local` file.
   - Add the `ASSISTANT_ID` you just copied.

   ```bash
   ASSISTANT_ID=your-assistant-id
   ```

3. **Configure the Assistant with Functions and Instructions:**

   The JSON files and the instruction file you need to use for configuring the assistant are located in the `assistant/functions/` directory and in the `assistant/instruction.txt` file. Follow these steps to set them up:

   - **Load Functions:**

     - In the assistant configuration panel on OpenAI, find the section where you can add custom functions.
     - Upload the functions files located in the `functions/` directory.

   - **Add Instructions:**

     - In the same panel, there will be an area to add instructions to the assistant.
     - Copy the content of the `instruction.txt` file and paste it into the instruction area. These instructions will guide the assistant's behavior and how it should use the available functions.
